## AHK++ manual tests

As a final sanity check, here are some manual tests to run. Be sure to packag the extension and install from VSIX before executing them. Each file describes itself. Feel free to open a discussion if you have any questions :)

Files in this folder (but not in `languageVersion`) should always have a `.ahk2` or `.ahk1` extension for clarity, as AHK++ supports both AHK v1 and AHK v2.
